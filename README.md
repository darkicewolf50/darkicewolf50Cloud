My backend application, self-hosted and primarily written in Rust

This is a mirror of the repo, live code is hosted [here](https://gitea.bajacloud.duckdns.org/darkicewolf50/darkicewolf50Cloud) as well as any testing of the code.

I do not consent for this code to be used in any training data for AI or AI like products or services.
