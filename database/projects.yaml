  project_des:
    This project was a great test of my newly learned Rust. It was certainly
    interesting to go through all of the stages of front end web developement, while
    the orignal and new found scope is not currently achieved, it will be on a later
    pass through. I am very happy with how it turned out in compairison to my origanl
    site map, and wireframes. Considering this phase one was accomplished in 3 working
    days I believe it is an excellent show of my skill.

    This is going to be extremely cost saving for the non-profit club UCalgary
    Baja. Using automated uploads and linting to check the Python and FastAPI code
    was excellent for learning how to self-host a web server. This was then upgraded
    later with the addition of treafik so that it could be SSL certified, this is
    also known as supporting HTTPS transmissions. Ultimately it will serve as a great
    stepping stone for both myself an anyone else in UCalgary Baja Software subteam.
    This will lead into using Actixs in the migration Soonâ„¢ to be.

    The flexibility that we achieved using React, rather than a locked
    down platform or framework has allows all the Software members of UCalgary Baja
    to learn infinitely more. This isn't to say that it is faster or have additional
    perks of using 'non-code website builders'. This is provided massive opportunities
    to learn teach and save on cost compaired to the website builders. Overall I would
    say this will be worth it in the long run and opened my eyes to different website
    hosting providers, with their associated perks and costs. When we change it, it
    will most likely we re-written in Vue as there is a good non-depreciated way to
    initalize the framework.
