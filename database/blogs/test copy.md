We're excited to have you and your unique individual skills and experience contributing to the mission of creating the best car possible. The lessons you will learn and the accomplishments you will make are up to you, and UCalgary Baja will gladly work alongside you to push you to your limits and beyond.

## What do you get out of Baja

This is based on the 2018 Baja charter

### Camaraderie & Lasting Friendships

UCalgary Baja is a team where strong, long-lasting friendships are made. This camaraderie aids in both successful teamwork and personal well-being. Outside of the workshop, team members network between classes they share with one another. As well, the team is no stranger to celebrating a hard-working day by going out together to catch a movie, grab refreshments, or even just hang out.

### Career Opportunities

UCalgary Baja provides you the opportunity to network with industry professionals from numerous industries, most notably in the automotive sector with the likes of Honda, Ford Motor Company, Volvo, Cummins, and many more. Alumni from the team have established engineering careers at such companies as these.

This will be investigated promptly and action will be taken depending on the severity.

## Consequences / Infractions

1. Continuing underperformance and/or not meeting deliverables or commitments will lower your standing/ranking in attending competition
2. If there is still continued underperformance, UCalgary Baja may enact removal from the team

It is important to note that issues and concerns in performance addressed by UCalgary Baja will be dealt with on a case-by-case basis for every member. UCalgary Baja understands that there are circumstances in life that are beyond anyone's control and will work with you to best solve these issues. If issues continue to persist and impact your ability to fulfill your commitment to UCalgary Baja, approach us to have a discussion and we can have you reevaluate roles and responsibilities on the team.

### DEI Software Specific Mandates

We do not have a mandate, the only mandate is trying to fill a full hotel room if gender matters/applicable.

ex. Fill a women's hotel room, **_PLEASE AVOID_** this situation, the worst is a half or quarter, please aim for as many full rooms if possible.

## Roles and Expectations

based upon the 2018 Baja Charter

### All Members

- Your position on this team is a privilege, not a right.
- All members will follow through with commitments in a timely matter or inform your Team Lead/Team Captain if you cannot.

- Software Lead is on Internship, Wednesdays will either be optional or lead by a Senior member or Future Software Lead
- Team members will need to be a part of all phases of your assigned project and possibly projects that you aren't part of - Design, & Coding. This ensures that mistakes, issues, and concerns are addressed ASAP and corrected accordingly.
- Asking questions is encouraged and is the greatest way for you to learn. Every member will be open to taking questions. If you are unable to answer a question either admit that "I don't know", or suggest someone who may be better qualified to answer the question. Asking questions is beneficial for both parties as it expands the asker's knowledge base, and keeps the question recipient current with their knowledge
- Googling the docs or Stackoverflow is a great start

### Juniors

- Are expected to work and ask questions. Enthusiasm to learn and a positive attitude is a must!

### Intermediates

- In addition to Junoir Member roles and expectations:
- Expected to carry out some of their own research and ask whatever questions they may have about their project. They may not necessarily know everything about the language/project but must make an effort to verse themselves as completely as they can.
- Can Volunteer to teach Juniors and other members new skills and assist in the transfer of knowledge.
- A Developmental level amount of time management to ensure adequate research and development of your design projects is a must.

### Seniors

## Seasons

There are multiple phases throughout the year. As UCalgary Baja is a competition team focused on performing well all members are expected to have full involvement in each phase. The Baja year can be broken down into the following cycle (It is important to note that each phase may feather into one another):

Timelines in Software are flexible this is a guide to the year not a set in stone, some project scopes may take longer than others.

### 2025 Season Edit **Mech/Electrical**

This year the school has reduced the nubmer of shop tech hours and removed many alot of the shop time in favor of a class, this mean that everyone is under crunch and we only get a limited amount of time, limited number of people we can train to work in the machine and one designated cnc machine that must be used or we lose it

### Summer - Testing **Mech/Electrical**

This is when UCalgary Baja tests the previous vehicle to influence designs for the future vehicle. Testing consists of gathering data from the previous vehicle to influence design decisions for the new vehicle. Such tests may include strain gauge impact testing, vehicle roll testing, transmission dynamometer characterization, etc.

#### Summer Semster 2025 Season Edit **Mech/Electrical**

The new car designs start here, we need something for Fall to be made. This does not mean summer testing cant happen at the same time but rather creating something for the Fall manufacting timeslot is more important.

### Summer - Testing **Software**

The software could get involved in this time, this time should primarily be used for the setup/preparation for the new season, recruitment period, and any SSAF requests and allowing for the new lead to get situated and plan the projects for the year, this time also allows the old lead to mentor as well as they can the new lead.
This is a time where a break can be taken such as only meeting every second week.

### Fall Semster 2025 Season Edit **Whole Team**

A number of deliverables get done

1. SSAF funding for the main manufacturing period (Winter Semster)
1. Recuitment

### Fall Semester - Design **Mech/Electrical**

The design period involves brainstorming, drafts, CAD modelling, design reviews, system collaboration, document creation, drawing submission, hardware sourcing, material sourcing and manufacture sourcing for all projects.

#### Fall Semster 2025 Season Edit **Mech/Electrical**

For fall this means that as much manufacting as possible happens here, any finished designs are manufactured by the new (and forced upon) manufacting group/team, this happens at the same time as designs are being made/CADed.

New members of the manufacting group are trained during this time, the number of new people is determined by the university/machine shop and then is selected based upon commitment and free time during the week (sorry we this sometimes happens to be the only times available for us to get into the shop)

### Fall Semester - Easier Projects **Software**

This is the time when either your first or the easier projects happen, typically the projects involve higher-level languages like Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS or high-level programming where the background level is low, it should be typically reserved for learning opportunities even if the club needs the tool.
This is a time for learning and enforcing good programming rules.
Recruitment also happens during this time which reduces the amount of time able to be spent on complex projects.

### Winter Semester - Fabrication **Mech/Electrical**

Time to get your hands dirty! Fabrication is when the car is built and parts are submitted to machine shops. Learn to use tools and understand the importance of designing for manufacturability. This period provides the opportunity to learn the most about the vehicle, how its projects and systems work together, and assemble a vehicle!

#### Winter Semster 2025 Season Edit **Mech/Electrical**

Not much changes here other than the manufacting team is in full swing, anything else that is made outside of the machine shop goes on as normal.

### Winter Semester - Harder Projects **Software**

The concepts learned from the fall semester are now built upon in more difficult tasks such as testing (boundary, inner whatever the lead decides is appropriate to accomplish)
This time can also be spent wrapping up easier projects, possibly continuing on with projects that were originally thought to be easy but instead turned out to be difficult

### Late Winter to Early Spring - Pre-Competition Testing **Mech/Electrical**

In this phase, tests will be performed to validate the new vehicle's designs. Examples of tests performed are torsion tests, locating center-of-gravity, impact testing, transmission dynamometer, etc.

#### Late Winter to Early Spring 2025 Season Edit **Mech/Electrical**

Normally this is our crunch time, please expect to spend up to 13 hours a day on Baja. This does not mean school comes second, this is just meant to inform you

### Late Winter to Early Spring **Software**

No changes from the start of the Winter Semester
The addition of the Online Cost Report is the responsibility of the lead and senior members collaborating with electrical members.
Rules for software as of the 2025 season
If any data collection system is on the car it must be included then a software component of the Online cost report must be completed.

**The SSAF travel fund is a priority and any work can be stopped to help finish it**

**We do not go to comp if no SSAF travel fund is completed**

### Just Before Competition - Vehicle Tuning & Driver Training **Mech/Electrical**

Vehicle tuning consists of testing and recording multiple setups of the drivetrain, suspension, and braking systems. This allows the team to find the best settings for each event the vehicle will come up against. Alongside tuning, drivers who prove themselves as confident, comfortable, and skilled in the driver's seat will be chosen to drive specific events at the competition. Efforts will be taken to emulate events and train drivers accordingly.

### Just Before Competition 2025 Season Edit **Whole Team**

A SSAF funding round happeens so that we get buy things for the Fall Semster manufacturing period

### Just Before Competition **Software**

If reasonable Software transforms into the tool fetchers if work is behind

Other tasks include cleaning the truck (with a shop vac) cleaning the trailer (sweeping dirt out) and removing any garbage from the truck and trailer.

The reason why is that your fellow members are going to spend 10+ hours living there, so make sure it is comfortable for them and so that they do not have to clean it before driving to the competition

Reasonable is no juniors or other members available to perform this task.

The highest priority is to get the car out the door.

### May to June - Competition

The moment we've all been waiting for! Competition is where all your blood, sweat, and tears invested in the vehicle pay off. It is the ultimate testament to what the vehicle was designed to do. The competition consists of static events (business and design presentations), dynamic events (acceleration, maneuverability, hill climb, suspension & traction, and rock crawl), and finally a 4-hour endurance race.

### May to June - Competition **Software**

We help where we can, that could be running the sim for the driver, fetching tools (hence why the previous phase), taking photos, helping businesses, helping where you can

### Repeat

Summer is the transition phase, and Fall is the start of a new season
Prepare for the next phase as well as you can
